CS:GO Inspects is a simple mod that allows you to twirl around and look at your items in a new light. I took some inspiration from CS:GO, as the name implies, however the animation is quite bad right now.
Any and all improvements are welcome, simply submit a pull request to the [repo](https://github.com/maganoos/csgo-inspects). :)
